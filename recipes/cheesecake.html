      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        A perfect breakfast treat for brunches, Valentine's Day, breakfast in
        bed, or Mother's Day.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Whisk together the flour, milk, eggs, honey, and salt in a bowl to
          make a smooth batter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a nonstick crepe pan over medium heat
          until the foam disappears. Pour about 2 tablespoons of the batter into
          the pan, and swirl to cover the bottom of the pan with a thin layer of
          batter. Cook until the crepe is no longer runny, about 1 minute; flip
          and cook the other side for an additional 1 minute. Repeat with
          additional butter and crepe mix, to make 4 crepes. Set the crepes
          aside on paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a bowl, mix the cream cheese with 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar to
          make a creamy spread. Very gently stir in the berries. Spread the
          cream cheese filling evenly over the crepes and roll up. Refrigerate
          until chilled; slice in 1-inch sections to serve.
